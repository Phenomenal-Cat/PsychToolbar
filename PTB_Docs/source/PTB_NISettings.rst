The National Instruments (NI) Settings GUI allows the user to quickly set channel mappings for NI data acquisition (DAQ) devices in order to route analog and digital signals. National Instruments DAQs can be used as an alternative to the :ref:`DataPixx <PTB_DatapixxSettings>` DAQ. All variables controlled by the NI settings GUI are saved to the :ref:`NI field <Params-NI>` of the Params structure.
